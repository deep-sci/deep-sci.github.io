# Introduction
The Literary Network Visualizer project aims to identify and render conceptual connections between various books.
This involves mapping the relationships and thematic similarities across a diverse range of literary works.
The process of identifying proximal or related books is facilitated by the use of large language models (LLMs),
which analyze and interpret the underlying concepts and themes within the texts to uncover meaningful connections.
This approach allows for a comprehensive and nuanced visualization of the literary network,
highlighting the intricate web of interrelated ideas and narratives.

The project employs large language models (LLMs) to generate embedding values for the books.
